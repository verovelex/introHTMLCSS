# introHTMLCSS
This repository contains my test project for a website.
The purpose of this project is to experiment with different web development techniques and tools, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a sandbox environment where I can test ideas, learn new concepts, and refine my skills before applying them to a live website.
Please note that this project is a work in progress, and the content and structure may change frequently as I experiment with various features and approaches.
